Coding often brings back childhood memories. A new subject in coding can often feel very much like a child learning how to ride a bike.
Growing up I would always look forward to our yearly family trips to the beatiful green mountains of Lake Placid. One of my favorite summer activities was to bike the mountains without the fear of hitting the concrete sidewalks of Brooklyn.
To my surprise, I woke up one morning to find out that my bike’s helper wheels are GONE! The challenge seemed gigantic for the little me. My mother assured me that there was no reason to fear, she will hold onto my bike-seat while I ride. However, she only did so for about a minute, and unbeknownst to me I was riding the bike on my own!

When I was challenged with coding a Sinatra project on my own, it felt like a little child trying to ride an adult bike. Can I really do this without the “helper wheels” - the detailed instructions that a typical coding lab comes with?
After I met with a technical coach,  my confidence had been restored. I realized that the tools needed to succeed were already there, all I needed was the first push to “bike” through it on my own!
