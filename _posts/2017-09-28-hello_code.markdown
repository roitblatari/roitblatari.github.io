With a rabbinnical ordiantion in hand, a certified scribe, and exploring chaplaincy. Married with 2 kids, a friend introduced me to the world of code.

So much to learn, explore and discover, every new step in coding is a fascinating new path of opportunities. To gain and to give, growing and advancing the world into a better place for all humanity.

"I have learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and the most from my students" (Talmud)

While I do not consider myself a teacher, I do relate to the immense fulfillment one can experience by helping others. They will ultimately reach higher perspectives on a personal level.
It definitely felt good doing a friend a favor, only later did I come to the realization that I am greatly benefiting from it as well.
